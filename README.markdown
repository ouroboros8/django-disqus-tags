# django-disqus-tags

django-disqus-tags is an updated, stripped-down version of
[arthurk/django-disqus](https://github.com/arthurk/django-disqus) for django 1.7
and python 3.4.

It provides a small selection of template tags for easy inclusion of DISQUS
threads in django projects.

NB: this project does not include support for django's built in comments engine
(which is deprecated).
